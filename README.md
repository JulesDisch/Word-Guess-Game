# Word-Guess-Game

This is my word guess game, and this is the read me file.

I chose 90s bands that are only one word because I couldn't figure out if adding the option for spaces in addition to letters was possible with the code.

while the theme looks kinda lame, it's in the spirit of www.azlyrics.com: a site that has never changed its appearance since it first launched.
