# Word-Guess-Game

This project is a word guess/hangman type game, using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML, as well as a custom CSS.
All of the possible words are 90s bands, and the theme is based off of a popular site for finding lyrics, www.AZLyrics.com.
Even though AZLyrics got its start in 2000, I have always loved how they have seemingly never updated the site's appearance in the last 20 years.
The game uses keyup functionality to advance, as well as modals. The modals show the correct answer, along with the album art of one of that band's 90s albums.
The modals can be closed by clicking the "keep playing" button, hitting the "enter" or "space" keys, or clicking the mouse outside the modal.
The win/loss record is kept track of at the bottom of the screen, and once the user has gone through all 9 bands that are options for the game, they will see "game over" and their final score.
They will then have the option to play again, which will randomize the order of the bands, and put their win/loss record back at 0/0.
The deployed version can be found at https://julesdisch.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/index.html
